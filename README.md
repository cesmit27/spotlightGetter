Gets the windows spotlight images currently being used by your machine and saves them as .jpg files so you can use them elsewhere.

To run the Python script, replace \<user\> in the following line with your actual username:

`spotlight_folder = "C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\Microsoft.Windows.ContentDeliveryManager_cw5n1h2txyewy\\LocalState\\Assets"`

You also need to set the destination folder path that you want. For example, you can put it in the downloads folder:

`destination_folder = r"C:\Users\\<user\>\Downloads"`
